                        <p>4th part of Harry Potter. It was published on July 8, 2000. This year, Harry came along with the Weasleys and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. There was a very disturbance with the Death Eaters(Voldemort's supporters). Someone conjured the Dark Mark of Voldemort. After some days, they returned to Hogwarts. They became aware that the Triwizard Tournament was going to be held that year. Three memebers were chosen from three schools, but very unexpectedly Harry's name came out of the goblet. He was still underage. It seemed that someone had entered his name to it. Harry and others got some very difficult tasks. Harry solved the first problem with a hint given by their new teacher Mad-Eye Moody. He solved the second problem with the help of a house-elf Dobby. Then, at the last task, he and the other champion of Hogwarts touched the cup and it turned to a Portkey. They went to a distant village once he dreamed. Then, someone tortured them and used Harry's blood. Then, with a horror, Voldemort returned. He tried to kill Harry. But his wand didn't support him, because his and Harry's wand were of feather of a same phoenix. Harry returned to castle with the deadbody of Cedric. Then, Proffessor Moody took him to his room. Moody was very excited to know about all and said tha it was him, who put his name. All became clear when Dumbladore Stunned him. It wasn't "Mad-Eye Moody". It was a Death Eater Jr. Barty Crouch. He entered Harry's name to finish him and rise Voldemort again. He was conjured by the dementor from ministry after that. And real Moody was in the trunk for nine months.</p>

They was amazed, after returning at school, that Proffessor Snape has replaced as the D.A.D.A. and Slughorn was replaced as the Potions Master. According to Proffessor McGonagall, he chose the Potions as subject. He got an old book, what's owner called himself "The Half-Blood Prince". That's not a simple book, there was spells seemed to be invented by the Prince. Dumbladore started giving Harry private lessons about Voldemort. Harry had to discover a memory of Slughorn. As soon as he got it, it was clear how Voldemort became immortal. He has made seven Horcruxes of his soul. Harry and Dumbladore had finished 3 of them and they had to discover the other 4. Harry and Dumbladore went out in search of them. Dumbladore became weak. As soon as they returned there was the Dark Mark all over the Astronomy tower. They sped towards it. Harry was in his Invisibility Cloak and as they reached there, Malfoy disarmed Dumbladore. Harry was told to inform Snape, But he didn't move. After a while, the whole Death Eaters including Snape, came in. It was a trap and Snape was a Death Eater. Snape shot the Avada Kedavra, the killing curse towards Dumbladore. And Dumbladore died!
