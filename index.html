                        <p>4th part of Harry Potter. It was published on July 8, 2000. This year, Harry came along with the Weasleys and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. There was a very disturbance with the Death Eaters(Voldemort's supporter). Someone conjured the Dark Mark of Voldemort. After some days, they returned to Hogwarts. They became aware that the Triwizard Tournament was going to be held that year. Three memebers were chosen from three schools, but very unexpectedly Harry's name came out of the goblet. He was still underage. It seemed that someone had entered his name to it. Harry and others got some very difficult tasks. Harry solved the first problem with a hint given by their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad-Eye Moody. He solved the second problem with the help of a house-elf Dobby. Then, at the last task, he and the other champion of Hogwarts touched the cup and it turned to a Portkey. They went to a distant village once he dreamed. Then, someone tortured them and used Harry's blood. Then, with a horror, Voldemort returned. He tried to kill Harry. But his wand didn't support him, because his and Harry's wand were of feather of a same phoenix. Harry returned to castle with the deadbody of Cedric. Then, Proffessor Moody took him to his room although Dumbladore said to stay there. Moody was very excited to know about all and said tha it was him, who put his name. All became clear when Dumbladore Stunned him. It wasn't "Mad-Eye Moody". It was a Death Eater Jr. Barty Crouch. He entered Harry's name to finish him and rise Voldemort again. He was conjured by the dementor from ministry after that. And real Moody was in the trunk for nine months.</p><br><br>
